# My Favorite Recipes4
Organize all your favorite recipes!

Keep track of:
1. which cookbook your recipe is in and the page number
2. or the URL to your favorite recipe
3. a picture of the prepared dish
4. Notes on what the heck went wrong, or what you had to change
    1. e.g. used different ingredients, or how much

Also:
1. Rate the 'true' effort level to prepare the ingredients and cook the meal
   and the time it took from prep work to completion!
